The Allspark is a mashup of many API's ultimately resulting in a powerful yet simple interface that allows the user to accomplish tasks such as email and tweet by simply making a phone call. Users can listen to recent tweets read to them over the phone as well as post new tweets by placing a call. Wikipedia and Wolframalpha also provide data and computational power, so users can simply call a number to solve complex math problems or research a topic. SMS can also be used instead of a call.

Our target user is one that does not always have access to internet or wants to reduce data consumption. Since all our communications happens over a telephone line, no internet is required. Users who do not have smartphones would especially benefit.

The feature we are most proud of is having Allspark speak answers back to you as well as the accurate voice recognition when posting tweets.
